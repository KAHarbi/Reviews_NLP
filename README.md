## Background
In this project, we will use data from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abedkhooli/arabic-100k-reviews). It's some Arabic datasets are on the market for classification comparison and different NLP tasks. This dataset is principally a compilation of many available datasets and a sampling of 100k rows.it is a talk abaote reviews and this review hsa three type Negative, Positive and Mixed.

## Data Description 
The dataset combines reviews of hotels, books, movies, products, and some airlines. It has three classes (Mixed, Negative and Positive). Most were mapped from rater scores with a mix of 3, more than 3 positives, and less than 3 negatives. Each line has a label and text separated by tabs (tsv). The (reviews) text has been cleaned up by removing Arabic diacritics and non-Arabic characters. The dataset does not have duplicate revisions.
